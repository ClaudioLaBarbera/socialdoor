SocialDoor
==========

SocialDoor is an open-source social network based on AJAX with PHP and MySQL.

It was created in 2012 for fun and for my high school graduation's exam, but nobody was interested in it. So now, I decided to make it open-source to give people the opportunity to modify and reuse it however they want.

After some years I decided to develop again SocialDoor using MVC Pattern, but it is still a beta version. If you need a stable version you can find the first version in releases'page (https://github.com/thebatclaudio/socialdoor/releases).
