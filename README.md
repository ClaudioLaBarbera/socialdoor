SocialDoor
==========

SocialDoor is an open-source social network based on AJAX with PHP and MySQL.

It was created in 2012 for fun and for my high school graduation's exam, but nobody was interested in it (LOL). 

So now, I decided to make it open-source to give people the opportunity to modify and reuse it however they want.

Programming languages
==========

- XHTML
- CSS
- JavaScript and jQuery (for animations and AJAX technology)
- PHP
- SQL (I used mysql php functions, so it can be used only in a MySQL database)

Dependencies
==========

- jQuery Validate (http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation)
- jCrop (https://code.google.com/p/jcrop/)
- jQuery miniColors (https://github.com/claviska/jquery-miniColors)
